# CP-Coding-Standards
An attempt of satisfying everyone and still have some standards.

These Coding standards are aimed towards Theme and Plugin _reviewers_.
Developers are still encouraged to actually use a more thorough Standard ([WPCS `WordPress` standard](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) would be highly recommended).
The ruleset should help when revieweing plugins for security issues and not serve as a referece of what quality code looks like.

This rulest is _NOT_ to be used for CP Core either.
Public discussion that lead to this ruleset can be found [here](https://forums.classicpress.net/t/adopt-wpcs-for-themes-and-plugin-directory/3755/)

Anyone can Conribute to this ruleset happens _after_ something has been discussed in the public forum.
While crafting code compliant with this ruleset _will_ make it easier for your plugin to be listed on the CP Directory, it does _not_ guarantee it, since there are many other conditions to be fullfilled.
Again, this is NOT a "good" coding standard to improve your CodeBase in general. 
It would be better to use the more complete WPCS, and if you follow that, it will pass this Ruleset without issues.
This ruleset is intended only for Reviews, so we do not need to bug people about spaces, short or long form array, and the likes.
